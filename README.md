# wreath-network
I attempted TryHackMe's Network room Wreath as a part of my preparation for the PNPT.

The room teaches important skills like Pivoting (moving inside a network) which is imperative for any aspiring penetration tester.

What will you find in this repository?

1. An Assessment of components.

2. Attack Summary

3. Tools used with url links to download them.

4. List of commands categorised as per their functions

5. A write-up explaining the pivoting methodology.


6. A full penetration test report (based on the TCM sec sample report)


I would really appreciate any feedback or suggestions.
