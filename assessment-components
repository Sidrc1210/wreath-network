#Assessment Components

The penetration test encompassed the following components:
•	External Penetration Testing (EPT):
Targeted the organization’s publicly accessible infrastructure. This phase included enumeration, vulnerability identification, and exploitation of external-facing services to gain initial access.
•	Internal Penetration Testing (IPT):
Simulated a scenario where an attacker had gained a foothold within the internal network. This included privilege escalation, lateral movement, pivoting through internal systems, and extraction of sensitive credentials and files.
•	Persistence and Post-Exploitation:
Evaluated the extent to which an attacker could maintain access and further compromise the network, including the creation of user accounts, installation of backdoors, and service abuse.
•	Tool Utilization:
A combination of manual testing techniques and open-source tools such as Nmap, Mimikatz, Evil-WinRM, sshuttle, Chisel, and PowerShell Empire were employed to ensure thorough assessment coverage.
•	Adherence to Frameworks and Standards:
The engagement was conducted in alignment with industry standards, including the MITRE ATT&CK framework, OWASP Top 10, and NIST SP 800-115.
